+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented, evaluated and compared algorithms for Machine Learning Fairness. Our study compared two different algorithms, Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen) and Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection (FFS). Implementation and evaluation was based on the COMPAS dataset, which contains the criminal history, jail and prison time, demographics, and COMPAS rosk scores for defendants from Broward County from 2013 and 2014. Our goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of the above algorithms.
